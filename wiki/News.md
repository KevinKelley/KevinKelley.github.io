Posts are inserted always right after the &#091;post:&#093; tag, this way the latest post is always first.  Normally this page would also be protected from editing, perhaps with a different password than the post password and the menu at the bottom could also be hidden .  The link below for initiating posting may be on a different page.

The XML bimap  is a link for xml/rss syndication. The setup function should be used to set correct RSS channel information. RSS v2.0 is used since version 3.7.

Creating a post page is easy, simply include a &#091;post:''secret''&#093; tag on the page where posts should be inserted, ''secret'' is the password needed for posting.

For each posts a comments page and counter will be created automatically. The comments page has the subject title or the whole post at the top depending on setup.
