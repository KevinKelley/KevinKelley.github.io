A wiki link points to a page in the same wiki system. A wiki link must not contain dot '.' or forward slash '/' characters but may have any combination of letters numbers and spaces. The whole page name is surrounded by double brackets:

 [Wiki Link](/wiki/Wiki_Link.html)

Non existing pages will be displayed with question marks around it: [unknown](/wiki/unknown.html). By clicking on such a link, a new page can be created and edited.

If running with flat-files for data storage (if not using MySql, say), the wiki link needs to be a legal filename.
