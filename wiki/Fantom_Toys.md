Fan Toys and Samples
********************

I happened on to the [RosettaCode]`http://www.rosettacode.org` web site the other day,
and got inspired to do Fan translations of some of the neat problems listed there.
Anybody have a more elegant or "Fan-like" implementation of these?

[Bulls and Cows]`/fan/examples/BullsAndCows.html`

predates, and resembles, the MasterMind game.

[Man or Boy]`/fan/examples/ManOrBoy.html`

Donald Knuth's "man or boy" closure stress-test example, in Fan.

[RLE]`/fan/examples/RLE.html`

Run-length string encoder and decoder.

[Roman Numerals]`/fan/examples/RomanNumerals.html`

converts an int to its roman numeral.

[Sierpinski Carpet]`/fan/examples/SierpinskiCarpet.html`

generates a square Sierpinski Gasket.

[ZigZag array]`/fan/examples/ZigZag.html`

algorithm to access a rectangular array in zigzag order.

[Knapsack]`/fan/examples/Knapsack.html`

solves the Knapsack Packing problem, in a brute-force fashion.
