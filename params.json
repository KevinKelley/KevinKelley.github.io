  > “What did I want? I wanted a Roc's egg.  ...I wanted raw red gold in nuggets the size of your fist... I wanted to hear the purple water chuckling against the skin of the Nancy Lee in the cool of the morning watch and not another sound, nor any movement save the slow tilting of the wings of the albatross that had been pacing us the last thousand miles.  I wanted the hurtling moons of Barsoom. I wanted Storisende and Poictesme, and Holmes shaking me awake to tell me, "The game's afoot!"  I wanted to float down the Mississippi on a raft and elude a mob in company with the Duke of Bilgewater and Lost Dauphin.  I wanted Prester John, and Excalibur held by a moon-white arm out of a silent lake.  I wanted to sail with Ulysses and with Tros of Samothrace and to eat the lotus in a land that seemed always afternoon.  I wanted the feeling of romance and the sense of wonder I had known as a kid.  I wanted the world to be the way they had promised me it was going to be, instead of the tawdry, lousy, fouled-up mess it is.  I had had one chance ... Maybe one chance is all you ever get.”
  ― Robert A. Heinlein, Glory Road

  I am a freelance programmer, always interested in new challenges.  I've been all up and down the stack.  I like modern type-safe languages... Rust is a big current love of mine.  When I'm on JVM I like Kotlin, I think it's what Java wanted to be.

  I'm probably available for work, contact me if you've got something interesting needs done, maybe I can help.

  best!


### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\n
This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects.
Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a
designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n
\r\n
```\r\n
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n
$ git fetch origin\r\n
$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n
```\r\n
\r\n
If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n
\r\n
### Designer Templates\r\n
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse
through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your
page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be
preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n
\r\n
### Rather Drive Stick?\r\n
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository
to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support
Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll
makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page.
It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n
\r\n
### Authors and Contributors\r\n
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element
will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt),
PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n
\r\n
### Support or Contact\r\n

support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n
