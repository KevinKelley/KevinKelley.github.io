> “What did I want? I wanted a Roc's egg.  ...I wanted raw red gold in nuggets the size of your fist... I wanted to hear the purple water chuckling against the skin of the Nancy Lee in the cool of the morning watch and not another sound, nor any movement save the slow tilting of the wings of the albatross that had been pacing us the last thousand miles.  I wanted the hurtling moons of Barsoom. I wanted Storisende and Poictesme, and Holmes shaking me awake to tell me, "The game's afoot!"  I wanted to float down the Mississippi on a raft and elude a mob in company with the Duke of Bilgewater and Lost Dauphin.  I wanted Prester John, and Excalibur held by a moon-white arm out of a silent lake.  I wanted to sail with Ulysses and with Tros of Samothrace and to eat the lotus in a land that seemed always afternoon.  I wanted the feeling of romance and the sense of wonder I had known as a kid.  I wanted the world to be the way they had promised me it was going to be, instead of the tawdry, lousy, fouled-up mess it is.  I had had one chance ... Maybe one chance is all you ever get.”

I am a freelance programmer, always interested in new challenges.  I've been all up and down the stack.  I like modern type-safe languages... Rust is a big current love of mine.  When I'm on JVM I like Kotlin, I think it's what Java wanted to be.

I'm probably available for work, contact me if you've got something interesting needs done, maybe I can help.

best!
